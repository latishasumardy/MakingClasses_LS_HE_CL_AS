Assignment: PLTW 2.1.2
Date: (date submitted)
Team Members: Latisha Sumardy, Hannah Edge, Arina Sobol, Camryn Lee 

Description:

This assignment was a lesson in making classes, and understanding subclasses, superclasses, and unit testing. The lesson taught us how to create a class, as well as how to write methods for the class. We learned how to make test suites and use them see whether our code is right or wrong. 

Team member roles in assignment: 

We all worked on the sections collaboratively.

Key Lessons learned:

Summarize what you think important teaching points from the lesson were.  Be sure to
include something from each part (I-V)

Part I: 
This section of the assignment was all about learning how to start making a class, and implementing methods to go along with it. The focus was learning how to write and run a basic test for our math function methods.

Part II:
This part was all about running tests with JUnit. We learned how this could be very useful--especially when you are trying to test more than one method at a time. It provides efficiency, and it allows you to see what went wrong easily. 

Part III:

Part IV:

Part V:
In your own words, how do you run your app in debug mode?
To start off you need to place breakpoints in your code, you would then press on debug in the settings and run a virtual device or plug in a device. Then a debug window should pop up.
What does the Debugger tab show?
The debugger tab shows what statements could be false. As well as what to perform and what to launch.
What do breakpoints do when you run your program?
The breakpoints allow you to run your code smoothly until you see and error and you can add a breakpoint. Allows you to skip sections you that you know have no errors.
How do you advance to the next line of code using the debugger?
There is a button called Step Over.
How do you switch from debugging back to running your app normally?
You would stop the debugger, then you would exit out of it, you will be back at your normal screen of your app.

Conclusion Questions:
When is it useful to have multiple instances of a class, rather than creating static methods and fields?
If you do not need to use an object then create a static method while if you need a bunch of objects its easier to use classes.

Compare and contrast each of the methods you have learned so far for troubleshooting Android apps. They are: logging, unit testing using JUnit, and debugging.
JUnit testing is basically a framework that collectively known as Sunit. Debugging is running through the code step by step allowing you to view what each line of code may do, and what variables are holding what data, which helps view mistakes you could have missed. When you are logging client code sends log requests to Logger objects. Each logger keeps track of a log level that it is interested in, and discards log requests that are below this level.
