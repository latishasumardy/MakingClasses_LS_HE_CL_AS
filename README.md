Date: (date submitted)
Team Members: Latisha Sumardy, Hannah Edge, Arina Sobol, Camryn Lee 

Description:

This assignment was a lesson in making classes, and understanding subclasses, superclasses, and unit testing. The lesson taught us how to create a class, as well as how to write methods for the class. We learned how to make test suites and use them see whether our code is right or wrong. 

Team member roles in assignment: 

We all worked on the sections collaboratively.

Key Lessons learned:

Summarize what you think important teaching points from the lesson were.  Be sure to
include something from each part (I-V)

Part I: 
This section of the assignment was all about learning how to start making a class, and implementing methods to go along with it. The focus was learning how to write and run a basic test for our math function methods.

Part II:
This part was all about running tests with JUnit. We learned how this could be very useful--especially when you are trying to test more than one method at a time. It provides efficiency, and it allows you to see what went wrong easily.

Part IV:
